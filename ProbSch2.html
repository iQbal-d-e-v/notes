  </header>

  <!-- 1. Real-World Data -->
  <section>
    <h2>1. Real-World Data</h2>
    <p>Imagine the entire world in 3D.</p>
    <p>Billions of people live on Earth.</p>
    <p>Each person has information attached to them, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Age</li>
      <li>Height and weight</li>
      <li>Income</li>
      <li>Education level</li>
      <li>Health details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This collection of information about people, objects, or events is what we call <strong>data</strong>.</p>
    <p>ðŸ’¡ But hereâ€™s the problem: The world has massive amounts of data. Itâ€™s impossible to look at it all at once.</p>
    <p>Thatâ€™s why we transform this real-world data into <strong>two-dimensional tables</strong> (rows and columns) so that a computer can store and process it efficiently.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 2. Collecting the Required Data -->
  <section>
    <h2>2. Collecting the Required Data</h2>
    <p>From this huge pool of data, you rarely need everything.</p>
    <p>For example, if you are studying studentsâ€™ exam scores, you donâ€™t need the income or health details of people.</p>
    <p>You only collect <strong>relevant data</strong> for your application.</p>
    <p>This collected data can be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Small data (sample)</strong>: Data about a small group (e.g., marks of 50 students in one class).</li>
      <li><strong>Large data (population)</strong>: Data about a very large group (e.g., marks of 10 lakh students across the country).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰ In statistics, sometimes we study small data (samples), and sometimes large data (entire populations).</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3. Representation of Data -->
  <section>
    <h2>3. Representation of Data</h2>
    <p>Once the data is collected, the next step is to represent it clearly so we can understand patterns.</p>
    <h3>(a) For Small Data</h3>
    <p>We can use simple charts and tables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frequency table</strong>: Shows how often each value occurs.</li>
      <li><strong>Frequency polygon</strong>: A graph that shows frequencies with connected points.</li>
      <li><strong>Pie diagram (pie chart)</strong>: Shows proportions using slices of a circle.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>(b) For Large Data</h3>
    <p>We need stronger methods because the dataset is huge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Histogram</strong>: A bar-like graph showing how data is spread over intervals.</li>
      <li><strong>Ogives (cumulative distribution graphs)</strong>: Help us see running totals and percentiles.</li>
      <li><strong>Stem-and-leaf diagram</strong>: Shows actual data values in a structured form, useful for identifying patterns.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. Summarizing Data -->
  <section>
    <h2>4. Summarizing Data</h2>
    <p>Instead of just looking at tables and graphs, we often want a single number to describe data.</p>
    <p>These are called <strong>measures of central tendency</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mean (average)</strong>: The balance point of the data.</li>
      <li><strong>Median</strong>: The middle value when the data is arranged.</li>
      <li><strong>Mode</strong>: The most frequent value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But numbers also vary, so we need <strong>measures of variability</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Variance</strong>: How far data values spread out from the mean.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard deviation</strong>: A square-root form of variance, easier to interpret.</li>
      <li><strong>Sample variance/standard deviation</strong>: Same as above but calculated for a sample.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰ These measures help us understand how consistent or spread out the data is.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. Interval Representation and Probability -->
  <section>
    <h2>5. Interval Representation and Probability</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, we group data into intervals (e.g., ages 0â€“10, 10â€“20, 20â€“30â€¦).</p>
    <p>Here, probability helps us understand how likely data falls into a certain range.</p>
    <p>One useful concept is <strong>Chebyshevâ€™s Inequality</strong>, which tells us how much data must lie within certain intervals around the mean.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: At least 75% of data lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This gives us bounds for probability, even if we donâ€™t know the exact distribution.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 6. Normal Distribution -->
  <section>
    <h2>6. Normal Distribution</h2>
    <p>One very common data pattern in the real world is the <strong>normal distribution</strong> (bell-shaped curve).</p>
    <p>Examples: height of people, exam scores, weight of newborn babies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most data lies near the mean (center).</li>
      <li>Very few data points lie far away (extreme values).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding normal distribution is essential because many statistical methods are based on it.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 7. Paired Data â€“ Scatter Plots -->
  <section>
    <h2>7. Paired Data â€“ Scatter Plots</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we study two variables together (e.g., hours studied vs. exam marks).</p>
    <p>To represent this, we use a <strong>scatter plot</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One axis shows the first variable.</li>
      <li>The other axis shows the second variable.</li>
      <li>Each point represents a pair of values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Scatter plots help us see relationships, like whether studying more leads to higher marks.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 8. Background Knowledge Needed -->
  <section>
    <h2>8. Background Knowledge Needed</h2>
    <p>To fully understand statistics, you need some mathematical foundations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Set Theory</strong> â€“ Understanding collections of elements.</li>
      <li><strong>Permutations and Combinations</strong> â€“ Ways to count arrangements and selections.</li>
      <li><strong>Basic Statistics</strong> â€“ From earlier classes.</li>
      <li><strong>Basic Probability</strong> â€“ Usually studied in class 11â€“12, helps calculate chances.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 9. Connecting to Real-Life Applications -->
  <section>
    <h2>9. Connecting to Real-Life Applications</h2>
    <p>Statistics is not just theoryâ€”it is widely used in solving real-world problems.</p>
    <p>For example, in <strong>Operations Research</strong>, statistics and probability are applied to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Game Theory</strong>: Making decisions in competitive situations.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory Control</strong>: Managing stock levels efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Waiting Line (Queue) Theory</strong>: Studying how long customers wait in line.</li>
      <li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Measuring how reliable a machine or system is.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰ Another very popular example is the <strong>Stock Market</strong>, where statistics are used to predict trends and validate decisions.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Summary -->
