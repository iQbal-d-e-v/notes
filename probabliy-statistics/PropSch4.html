  <!-- Overview -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine you have a <strong>giant bag of numbers</strong>—thousands of marks scored by students in an exam.  
      If I give you the full list, you’ll get lost.  
      So, in statistics, we don’t just dump data—we <strong>organize</strong> it so that patterns become visible <em>at a glance</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are <strong>three powerful ways</strong> to do this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Histogram</strong> – like a bar graph for continuous data</li>
      <li><strong>Ogive (Cumulative Frequency Curve)</strong> – like watching numbers “add up” step by step</li>
      <li><strong>Stem-and-Leaf Plot</strong> – like a mini-database that keeps original numbers visible</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Histogram -->
  <section>
    <h2>1️⃣ Histogram</h2>
    <p>
      Think of a histogram like a <strong>building skyline</strong> in a city.  
      Each building represents how many numbers fall into a certain range (class interval).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose exam marks range from <em>0 to 100</em>. We divide them into intervals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0–19, 20–39, 40–59, 60–79, 80–100</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, count how many students fall into each group:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0–19 → 2 students</li>
      <li>20–39 → 5 students</li>
      <li>40–59 → 10 students</li>
      <li>60–79 → 8 students</li>
      <li>80–100 → 5 students</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      On a graph:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>x-axis</strong> = class intervals (marks ranges)</li>
      <li><strong>y-axis</strong> = frequency (number of students)</li>
      <li>Draw bars with <em>no gaps</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ✅ The histogram immediately tells you where most students scored.  
      (Looks like most are in the <strong>40–59 range</strong>).
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Ogive -->
  <section>
    <h2>2️⃣ Ogive (Cumulative Frequency Curve)</h2>
    <p>
      The word <em>ogive</em> may sound fancy, but it’s simple.  
      It’s like saying: <strong>“How many students scored up to this mark?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Using the same data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Up to 19 → 2 students</li>
      <li>Up to 39 → 2 + 5 = 7 students</li>
      <li>Up to 59 → 7 + 10 = 17 students</li>
      <li>Up to 79 → 17 + 8 = 25 students</li>
      <li>Up to 100 → 25 + 5 = 30 students</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now plot:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>x-axis</strong> = upper class boundaries (19, 39, 59, 79, 100)</li>
      <li><strong>y-axis</strong> = cumulative frequency (2, 7, 17, 25, 30)</li>
      <li>Connect the points smoothly to form a rising curve</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ✅ This curve helps us find <em>medians, quartiles, percentiles</em>—things newspapers use when they say:  
      <strong>“Top 25% of students scored above 80 marks.”</strong>
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Stem-and-Leaf -->
  <section>
    <h2>3️⃣ Stem-and-Leaf Plot</h2>
    <p>
      Now imagine instead of graphing, you want to see the <strong>actual numbers</strong> but in an organized way.  
      That’s where the <strong>stem-and-leaf</strong> plot comes in.  
      Think of it like a <strong>tree</strong>: the “stem” is the main trunk (tens digit), and the “leaves” are hanging (ones digit).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example marks:</strong> 19, 22, 25, 42, 45, 50, 65, 77, 90</p>
    <p>We split them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stem = tens digit</li>
      <li>Leaf = ones digit</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
Stem | Leaves
  1  | 9
  2  | 2, 5
  4  | 2, 5
  5  | 0
  6  | 5
  7  | 7
  9  | 0
    </pre>
    <p>
      ✅ With one glance, you can see:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lowest = 19</li>
      <li>Highest = 90</li>
      <li>Cluster around 40–50</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It’s like a <strong>histogram without losing the raw data</strong>.
    </p>

  <!-- Why These Are Powerful -->
  <section>
    <h2>🌟 Why These Are Powerful</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Histogram</strong> → shows the shape of data (are scores high, low, spread out?)</li>
      <li><strong>Ogive</strong> → shows how data accumulates (good for medians/percentiles)</li>
      <li><strong>Stem-and-Leaf</strong> → compact but detailed snapshot (raw data + grouping)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That’s why newspapers, TV channels, and researchers all use these.  
      They take <strong>huge piles of data</strong> and convert them into something <em>our brains can digest quickly</em>.

  <section>
    <h2>🧑‍🏫 Professor's Question</h2>
    <p>
      👉 Now let me ask you (like a professor would):  
      If you were given the marks of your entire class, which method would you prefer to use first—histogram, ogive, or stem-and-leaf—and why?
