    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this video, weâ€™ll begin with the <strong>introduction to Probability and Statistics</strong>.  
      The entire course is divided into <strong>10 modules</strong>.  
      The first five modules will focus on <em>Probability</em>, and the remaining modules will cover <em>Statistics</em>.

  <!-- Flow of Concepts -->
  <section>
    <h2>ðŸŒ± Flow of Concepts</h2>
    <p>The study of Probability and Statistics moves step by step through the following stages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Collection</strong> â€“ The process always begins with collecting data.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong> â€“ After collecting, we carefully analyze the data.</li>
      <li><strong>Distributions</strong> â€“ From the analysis, we form distributions, which represent the pattern of the data.</li>
      <li><strong>Estimation of Parameters</strong> â€“ Once distributions are identified, we estimate or identify key parameters.</li>
      <li><strong>Decision-Making</strong> â€“ Based on the characteristics of the estimated parameters, we make decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus, the ultimate goal of Probability and Statistics is:  
      <span style="font-weight:bold;">ðŸ‘‰ Decision-making under uncertainty.</span>

  <!-- Importance in Real Life -->
  <section>
    <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Importance in Real Life</h2>
    <p>
      In real-world systems, <strong>uncertainty is everywhere</strong>. Some examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Economy</strong> â€“ Predicting trends, risks, and policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare</strong> â€“ Diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Logistics</strong> â€“ Optimizing supply chains and deliveries.</li>
      <li><strong>Stock Market</strong> â€“ Predicting market behavior and investment decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Computer Science</strong> â€“ Especially in machine learning and data science, where analysts make frequent decisions based on data patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In all these fields, decisions must be made repeatedly and within short time intervals.  
      If you take the correct decision, the system progresses.  
      If you fail even once, the entire system can collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatâ€™s why <em>collecting data, analyzing it, forming distributions, and estimating parameters</em> play a crucial role in making the right decisions.

  <section>
    <h2>ðŸ”® Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      In the next video, weâ€™ll begin with the <strong>introduction to Probability itself</strong>, 
      where youâ€™ll learn what probability is and how it builds the foundation for statistics and decision-making.
